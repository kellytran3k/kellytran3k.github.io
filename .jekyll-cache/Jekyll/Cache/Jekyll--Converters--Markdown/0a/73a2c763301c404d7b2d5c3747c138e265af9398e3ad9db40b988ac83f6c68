<p>This simulator is the result of a final group project for <strong>CS 4400</strong> <em>(Intro to Database Systems).</em></p>

<p>The goal of the project was to <em>fully implement</em> amd <em>simulate</em> the testing procedures used at
<strong>Georgia Tech</strong> during the <em>COVID-19 pandemic</em>.</p>

<p>This was done using a mock SQL database to read and update data with <strong>Flask</strong> and <strong>Python3</strong>. <strong>PyMySQL</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong> workbench was used for the database API and <strong>Anaconda</strong> for the virtual environment.</p>

<p>This system calls from a database to allow faculty and students to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>view and filter through available testing appointments</li>
  <li>set and update testing appointments</li>
  <li>view and filter through available testing sites</li>
  <li>view individual testing results</li>
  <li>filter and view congregated (pooled) testing results</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, lab technicians, site testers, and admins were able to
update data in real time.</p>

<p>Meaningful data includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>individual testing results</li>
  <li>pooled testing results</li>
  <li>testing sites</li>
  <li>testing appointments</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@app.route('/view_daily_results', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def view_daily_results():
    msg = ''
    # connects w database
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    # calls daily_results on database
    cursor.callproc('daily_results')
    connection.commit()

    # fetches the daily results
    cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM daily_results_result')
    resultDetails = cursor.fetchall()

    # returns daily results
    return render_template('view_daily_results.html',
        resultDetails=resultDetails)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>

<p>Through this project, I learned the <strong>integration process of SQL database with Python3</strong> in order to develop a web application that updated and retrieved data in real time. This was one of my first times using a <strong>virtual environment</strong> to implement code, as well as using <strong>MySQL</strong> to call datasets. The web application can be functionally run locally. However, there is currently no plan of putting this simulator online.</p>
