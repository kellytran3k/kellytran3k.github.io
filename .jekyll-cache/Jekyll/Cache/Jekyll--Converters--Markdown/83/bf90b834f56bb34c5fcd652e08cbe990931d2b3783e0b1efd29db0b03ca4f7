  <!-- about me -->

  <p><strong>Hello!</strong> I’m a 4th year at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a> studying <strong>Computer Science</strong>. My threads are in <a href="https://catalog.gatech.edu/programs/media-information-internetworks-computer-science-bs/">Infonetworks x Media</a>, and I am interested in the intersection of humans &amp; computers, info-security, and the ethics of computing.</p>

  <p>I’m the daughter of <strong>Vietnamese refugees</strong> and <strong>heroes</strong>. I was born and raised on the outskirts of Atlanta, in a low-income household in a majority minority area. I am a first-generation college student, meaning that I am the first person in my extended family to attend college. <strong>I am set to graduate from Georgia Tech in Spring 2022.</strong></p>

  <p>I am a curious individual who always aims to exceed expectations, and a fast learner in areas where I lack experience. Most of my technical knowledge comes from hackathons, classes, and <a href="/work/">experience</a> as a TA and research assistant. In addition, I have recently been introducting myself to info-security topics as well. I like to do practice by playing <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/">CTF wargames</a>. I strive to constantly learn, develop ethical code, and be the best who I can be. :)</p>
