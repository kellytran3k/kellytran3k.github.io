  <!-- about me -->

  <p><strong>Hello!</strong> Iâ€™m a 4th year at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a> studying <strong>Computer Science</strong>. My threads are in <a href="https://catalog.gatech.edu/programs/media-information-internetworks-computer-science-bs/">Infonetworks x Media</a>, and I am interested in the intersection of humans &amp; computers, info-security, and the ethics of computing.</p>

  <p>Iâ€™m the daughter of Vietnamese refugees and heroes. I was born and raised on the outskirts of Atlanta, in a low-income household in a majority minority area. I am a first-generation college student, meaning that I am the first person in my extended family to attend college. <strong>I am set to graduate from Georgia Tech in Spring 2022.</strong></p>

  <p>I am a curious individual who always aims to exceed expectations, and a fast learner in areas where I lack experience. Most of my technical knowledge comes from <strong>hackathons</strong>, <strong>classes</strong>, and <a href="/work/"><strong>experience</strong></a> as a TA and research assistant. In addition, I have recently been introducting myself to info-security topics as well. I like to do practice by playing <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/">CTF wargames</a>. I strive to constantly learn, develop ethical code, and be the best who I can be. :)</p>
