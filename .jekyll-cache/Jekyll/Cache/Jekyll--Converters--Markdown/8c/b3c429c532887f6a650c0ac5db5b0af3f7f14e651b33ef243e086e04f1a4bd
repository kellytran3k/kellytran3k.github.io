<p><strong>and Iâ€™m assuming youâ€™ve played Just Dance at least once in your life.</strong></p>

<p>Well, this is the best of both worlds!</p>

<p>The â€˜<em>Renegade</em>â€™ was a popular dance trend on social-media platform â€˜<em>Tik Tok</em>â€™ in 2020.
The popular choreography had over <strong>300,000 people</strong> dancing to it, and had a huge following of celebrities like <em>Kourney Kardashian</em>, <em>Bella Thorne</em>, and <em>Noah Schnapp</em> participating.</p>

<p>My hackathon team and I incorporated the â€˜<em>Just Dance</em>â€™ game concept which gave players a score based on how accurated they did the movements of the dance.</p>

<p>/<strong>Just Renegade was a submission for UGAHacks 5</strong>/</p>

<h2 id="application">Application:</h2>

<p>We developed a pseudo native app using Python and front-end web technologies. Users interact with a Selenium-controlled Chrome browser, which changes the text in an invisible paragraph tag to communicate with a Python script. This script controls the state of the game and even edits the DOM to display the video.</p>

<p>We used the OpenPose library to detect poses, and using some clever math involving calculating angles between points of interest, we compared the userâ€™s video to the original video to score their accuracy.</p>

<p>A result video with a skeleton tracking overlay is generated in addition to tons of json output data, upon which we conducted data analysis with Python scripts. All of this is then loaded with a Bootstrap/JQuery frontend and displayed as a webpage for the end user.</p>

<h2 id="built-with">Built With:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>OpenPose</strong> - Real-time multi-person keypoint detection library for body, face, hands, and foot estimation created and maintained by members of Carnegie Mellon University</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Selenium</strong> - a portable framework for testing web applications; provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests without the need to learn a test scripting language</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>NumPy</strong> - a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bootstrap</strong> - an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>JQuery</strong> - a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>TikTok</strong> - a video-sharing social networking service used to create short lip-sync, comedy, and talent videos</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>
<p>I mainly worked on JQuery frontend design. It was a great learning experience for me, and loads of fun. Probably the best hackathon Iâ€™ve been to yet!</p>
