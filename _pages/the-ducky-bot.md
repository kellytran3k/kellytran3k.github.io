## Takeaway:

We ended up winning **4th** overall. I was in charge of implementing the Twitter bot itself. The biggest challenge for me was using the **Twitter API** to send automated and consistent DMs (direct messages) to users from the bot. 

Oh look, there's my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kellyuyuu) cameo too!

This was *suprisingly* my first time actively working with **Python** ever (real shocker as a third-year, I know).

Well, now it's one of my favorite languages. Cool stuff ðŸ˜„ *Woo hoo!*~~
