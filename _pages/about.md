<!-- about me -->

**Hello!** I'm a 4th year at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu) studying **Computer Science**. My threads are in [Infonetworks x Media](https://catalog.gatech.edu/programs/media-information-internetworks-computer-science-bs/), and I am interested in the intersection of humans & computers, info-security, and the ethics of computing. 

I'm the daughter of Vietnamese refugees and heroes. I was born and raised on the outskirts of Atlanta, in a low-income household in a majority minority area. I am a first-generation college student, meaning that I am the first person in my extended family to attend college. **I am set to graduate from Georgia Tech in Spring 2022.**

I am a curious individual who always aims to exceed expectations, and a fast learner in areas where I lack experience. Most of my technical knowledge comes from **hackathons**, **classes**, and [**experience**](/work/) as a TA and research assistant. In addition, I have recently been introducting myself to info-security topics as well. I like to do practice by playing [CTF wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/). I strive to constantly learn, develop ethical code, and be the best who I can be. :)
