<!-- about me -->

**Hello!** I'm a recent grad from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu) after graduating with a Bachelor's of Science in **Computer Science**. My threads were in [Infonetworks x Media](https://catalog.gatech.edu/programs/media-information-internetworks-computer-science-bs/), and I am interested in full-stack software engineering particularly in consumer facing applications.

I'm the daughter of Vietnamese refugees and heroes. I was born and raised on the outskirts of Atlanta, in a low-income household in a majority minority area. I am a first-generation college student, meaning that I am the first person in my extended family to attend college.

I am a curious individual who always aims to exceed expectations, and a fast learner in areas where I lack experience. Most of my technical knowledge comes from **hackathons**, **classes**, and [**experience**](/work/) as an intern, TA, and research assistant. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [Affirm](https://www.affirm.com/).

**k-pop**
it's what i mostly listen to when i code lol. the combination of bubble gum pop and not understanding the lyrics is quite euphoric.
