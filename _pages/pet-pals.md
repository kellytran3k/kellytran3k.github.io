## MVP iOS application to gamify recycling in Atlanta

**Pet Pals** targets university students and aims to incentivise recycling through a virtual pet known as a *Pet Pal*.

I worked with **Georgia State University** to research how to use technology to *shift* behavioral actions and habits in college students. 

The application utilizes a **virtual pet** that has a depleting characteristics as time goes by. These characteristics include hunger and attention. Users have to go to registered recycling bins on the university campus to **scan a QR code** in order for their pet to receive 1 of 3 health points (food, care, or love) in order to keep their virtual pet happy.

## Utilized Technology:

- Google Maps API
- Firebase
- QR technology

...to create branching features to integrate gamification techniques into recycling behaviors.

## Takeaway:

This was my **first** big coding project. I was still taking introduction courses at this time. Tackling on an impactful project like *Pet Pals* was daunting to me.

However, I took the challenge head on. It was the most I've ever learned on a single project.
I was in charge of **setting up the entire app from scratch**. In the 6 months that I was there, I self-taugh myself **Swift**, **iOS** application development, and basic **UI/UX** research and techniques.
