  Hi! My **name** is [Kelly Tran](about/)
  and I recently found my passion for programming again.
    
  I am a **4th year** student studying **Computer Science** at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu), and I am currently interning at *Twitter* as a **Software Engineer** for Summer 2021.

  I have ample [experience](work/) with **front-end, back-end, and iOS development**.
  You can check out my latest work [here](project/). Outside of school, I love to study and play *CTF wargames* and *Info-Security* üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

  I do some [writing](articles/) about my interest here and there.

  Feel free to explore the page and reach out to me!
