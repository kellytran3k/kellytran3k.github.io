title: BanditOverTheWire Level 5 Walkthough

# Outline

I've been fascinated with the *info-security/cybersecurity* world lately. A friend of mine told me to start with [BanditOverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). **BanditOverTheWire** serves as an introduction to advanced terminal commands that allows a players to find the 'flag' in each level. Each flag serves as a password to get to the next level. At the time of writing this, I am on level 15. 

**I'd like to do a walkthrough of one of my favorite levels so far, level 5.**

To follow along simply run this command in your terminal:
> `ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220`

enter this password:
> `koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh`

# Concept

In level 5, the goal is to find the password that is stored in a nested directory in the `inhere` directory that is:

- human-readable
- 1033 bytes in size
- not executable

When we first `cd` into `inhere` and type in `ls`, we see that there are **multiple directories** that the password could be **hidden** in.

Upon using the command `cd maybehere00` to go inside the `mayberhere00` directory, we see that there are **many files inside the directory**.

**Oh no! What do we do?** Each directory has many files of their own as well. There's simply too many files for any sane person to check. We **have** to get the password somehow.

Luckily, we have a **set of commands** that the level advised us to take a closer look at.
We can type in the command line `man` following the command to open the manual and access the full description of what the command does. For now, here's the TLDR:
- `ls` - displays whats in a directory
- `cd` - jumps into a directory
- `cat` - prints whats in a readable-file
- `file` - determines file type
- `du` - estimates file space usage
- `find` - searches for files in a directory hierarchy

If we look closely at the manual for `find` we can see that there is a `-type` predicate that can be used after `find` to filter for a specific type of file.

Since we want to find something that is human-readable and regular, we will use `-type f`.

if we use `find ./ -type f` we still end up with a lot of files. 
Let's add to our command to see if we can narrow it down some more.

Next, we want to filter for **1033 bytes size** and **non-executable** file.

Going back to the `find` manual, we find other predicates that could be useful to use.

`-size` and `-executable` (make sure to add `!` in front of `-executable` because we are looking for a non-executable file!)

Thus, we combine all 3 predicates to make

`find ./ -type f -size 1033c ! -executable`

We simply `cat ./maybehere07/.file2` from here to find the password for level 9.
