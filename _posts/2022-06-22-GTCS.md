title: My Entire Computer Science Degree in a Single Blog
desc: a non-serious analysis on every cs/math course I took at Georgia Tech
---

So... I recently graduated from the **Georgia Institute of Technology** with a [**Bachelor's of Science** in **Computer Science**](https://www.parchment.com/u/award/2ecce36afc456672bb2fbe0ee05620a6) on May 07, 2022. It was a surreal experience walking on stage. Now I find myself, almost 2 months later, reflecting on my academic journey at Georgia Tech as an undergraduate transfer student. 

**So here, I'm going to be explaining my thoughts on every computer science and math class that I've taken at the institute. Just for fun. 😜**

Georgia Tech's CS program works in the way that each CS student chooses 2 threads of interest to customize their degree in.

The [GT CS threads](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/threads-better-way-learn-computing) are:
- 📲 Devices
- 💻 Info Internetworks 
- 🧠 Intelligence
- 👾 Media
- 🌆 Modeling & Simulation
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 People
- 🏛 Systems & Architecture
- 📚 Theory

The specific threads I chose were [Info Internetworks x Media](https://catalog.gatech.edu/programs/media-information-internetworks-computer-science-bs/).

The [**Info Internetworks**](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/threads/information-internetworks) thread focuses on "representing, transforming, transmitting, and pressenting information." The [**Media**](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/threads/media) thread focuses on "building systems to exploit computing's abilities to provide creative outlets," according to GT's official website.

I had a fair amount of transfer credits from dual enrollment and my time at Georgia State. I came into Georgia Tech exempting from the following classes:

- Intro to Computing (CS 1301)
- Intro Discrete Math (CS 2050)
- Differential Calculus (MATH 1551)
- Integral Calculus (MATH 1552)

So, these are the classes that I took during my time at Georgia Tech, what went down, what I learned, and general thoughts.

# Classes
---

**Intro to Object Oriented Programming (CS 1331)**

First class I took at Georgia Tech. The class is entirely in Java and the curriculum involved teaching the ins and outs of OOP. I ended up becoming a 3x teaching assistant for this course.

**Data Struct & Algorithms (CS 1332)**

This was my favorite course at Georgia Tech. It was tough, but I learned so much from Dr. Hudachek-Buswell. The TAs were gr8 and to this day I retain and use the concepts taught. 10/10

**Linear Algebra (MATH 1554)**

Weirdly enjoyed this class. I bombed the first exam with a 63 and cried for like 3 days. Made a great comeback though and finished strong with an 89. Matrices are really complex, yet really fun.

**Intro Multivariable Calculus (MATH 2550)**

Calculus 3, where we venture into Calculus 1 + 2 but in 3D! The content didn't interest me as much as the previous calc classes did, so I don't remember much of my experience.

**Objects and Design (CS 2340)**

A really essential course (and probably the most useful for SWEs) that isn't really taken seriously to GT kids. In the words of [Jarvis Johnson](https://youtu.be/XoSllabxqiQ?t=421), "I got a good grade, but I didn't learn what I was supposed to learn." This project based course was meant to teach us how to practice good software engineering techniques, but was mainly blown off since most students would prioritize it below other CS courses taken at the same time.

**Computers and Society (CS 4873)**

Ethics! We had weekly recitations of 8 where we would gather in a small room and discuss past engineering scandals and explored ethics. I wrote my [final paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IvnJkYL3WMLlvw_-nx3TcaCJSDSAbI1TOBJZrbtwAhc/edit?usp=sharing) analyzing facial recognition technology's impact on society. 

**Computer Organization & Program (CS 2110)**

Bits --> C Programming. Difficult. Rewarding. 10/10

**Systems and Networks (CS 2200)**

We built an entire computer within a computer. If you blinked during lecture, you were behind in 3 chapters. Projects were insane (in a good way) and Dr. Kishore Ramachandran is a yoga legend.

**Statistics & Applications (ISYE 3770)**

We learned things like probability, discrete distributions, hypothesis testing, multiple linear regressions. It was interesting to see how far statistics stretched, and definitely an important class regardless of major.

**Project Design (CS 3311) / Project Implementation (CS 3312)**

These classes are a part of GT's year long junior design requirement. Students form a team and is paired with an external client to fulfill a software engineering product need. Through this class, we gained an authentic real world experience by continuously communicating with our client, designing a software application based on their needs, prototyping, testing, and finally delivering an exceptional product to the client.

**Computer Graphics (CS 3451)**

I loved Computer Graphics. We used a lot of linear algebra concepts and learned how to appliy them to create beautiful computer graphics.

Here's some cool graphics we made out of pure JavaScript + math:

**Intro to Info Security (CS 4235)**

In info security, we learned the basics of security management and protocols. Some of our projects had us downloading a virus to get rid, and even creating our own malware. Pretty cool class, though I learned that info security wasn't for me.

**Design & Analysis-Algorithms (CS 3510)**

This is a mainly theory based class that was made especially enjoyable through Dr. Jacob Abernethy. We discussed intricate algorithms involving dynamic programming, graphs, cryptosystems, matrices, and more. 9/10!

**Computer Audio (CS 4590)**

A class about how to synthesize, manipulate, and program audio. I got a lot more out of this class than I thought! The projects were super engaging.

**Mobile Apps & Serv (CS 4261)**

In this hands on course, my group and I created an awesome mobile application with ReactNative that allowed GT TAs to organize and execute office hours.

**Video Game Design (CS 4455)**

Super fun course that involved learning how to use Unity software to create game animation, physics, AI, and prototypes. At the end of the semester, my group and I presented our [killer zombie game](https://youtu.be/csMYguDR-M4) that we made using Unity and C#.

**Applied Combinatorics (MATH 3012)**

My favorite math course at GT! It was really fun learning about how many ways the word **"banana"** can be permutated (the answer is 60 because 6!/(2!*3!) based on combination theory). The [free online textbook](https://www.appliedcombinatorics.org/book/app-comb.html) for this class is amazing.
