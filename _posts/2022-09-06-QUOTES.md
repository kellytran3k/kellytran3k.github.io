5. "When you fit in, you're fitting into norms that were created by other people. Now in some cases these norms are great, but in others they don't make sense. These norms, these rules, were created by someone like you or someone like me. Chances are they weren't anyone smarter than you or me. If I'm not a fan of how things are, I just do my own thing. Because I trust myself and I trust my perspective."

To see your way through anything that comes along. I know you will discover more courage and hope inside you than you even knew you had. I know that things will get better, day by day, and that the passage of time has a wonderful way of helping you see things in the right light. I know you can do every positive thing it takes to make it through any difficult time, because that's what **remarkable** people do. And one of those very special people, without a doubt, will always be you."
